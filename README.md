-  HighPerf-AI-ML-Inference
    A high-performance **C++ AI/ML inference engine** built using **ONNX Runtime (CPU by default, GPU opt-in)** with optional **LibTorch** support. This CLI + REST      API tool is cross-platform, powered by **CMake**, and deployable via **Docker** and **GitHub Codespaces**. It auto-fetches models/assets, includes a CUDA
    runtime check, and enforces CI-based merge gating. Future plans include multi-model and GPU training support.
  **Highlights:**
    1. Unified CPU/GPU inference — pick runtime flexibly
    2. CLI & REST interfaces for integration versatility
    3. Seamless asset/model fetching and environment validation
    4. Cross-platform builds with CMake and Docker
    5. Maintains high quality through CI gating on PRs
