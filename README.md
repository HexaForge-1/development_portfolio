-  HighPerf-AI-ML-Inference
   A high-performance C++ AI/ML inference engine built using ONNX Runtime (CPU by default, GPU opt-in) with optional LibTorch support. This CLI + REST API tool is      cross-platform, powered by CMake, and deployable via Docker and GitHub Codespaces. It auto-fetches models/assets, includes a CUDA runtime check, and enforces
   CI-based merge gating. Future plans include multi-model and GPU training support.
    1. Unified CPU/GPU inference — pick runtime flexibly
    2. CLI & REST interfaces for integration versatility
    3. Seamless asset/model fetching and environment validation
    4. Cross-platform builds with CMake and Docker
    5. Maintains high quality through CI gating on PRs
